# RayTracingInOneWeekend

I'll be following along this guide here: [Ray Tracking in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
Along the way, I plan on making a few optimizations, maybe using some GPGPU knowledge to speed things up a bit, but all in the nature of teaching myself graphics programming.
